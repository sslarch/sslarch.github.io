Abstract This session aims at evaluating how reproducible research in archaeology is actually faring. It has been argued that reproducible research techniques such as publishing and sharing code as well as data speed up scientific progress (Marwick 2017, Schmidt &amp;amp; Marwick 2020). With the FAIR movement and the rise of (Linked) Open Data approaches there seem to be more and more archaeological data sets available.</description></item><item><title>28th regular meeting</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2023-03-01/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2023-03-01/</guid><description>? ppl attended

Administrative matters Twitter/Mastodon: A Mastodon account is preferable, if possible via https://archaeo.social. In the future, both channels should be used in parallel for the moment. Ideally, a common interface should be found to avoid duplicating workflows. Automatisms should be considered and implemented, e.g. when a new protocol is published. Matrix: If possible and provided, the internal communication channel should be moved from Slack to Matrix. The implementation of the move will be communicated on Slack and in the mailing list.</description></item><item><title>25th regular meeting</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2022-12-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2022-12-12/</guid><description>6 ppl attended

It is a fact that no serious scientific research can be conducted without substantial and extensive collaboration.</description></item><item><title>How to navigate the coding archaeology world: an introduction to scientific co-creation using Git and Github</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/sessions/caa2022_workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/sessions/caa2022_workshop/</guid><description>When: 2022-08-08, 15:30 - 17:00 BTS

Abstract The archaeological community is moving beyond the traditional modes of scientific communication, such as research papers, monographs and conference talks, and interacts online on a daily basis. Especially for archaeologists, who use and develop advanced, computational tools, a new kind of platform increasingly extends mailing lists and social media here, and has proven invaluable for collaborative work: Version control systems to develop, share and test manuscripts, figures and code.</description></item><item><title>21st regular meeting</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2022-07-04/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2022-07-04/</guid><description>We had a busy and productive meeting today, where we explored how exactly the teaching material map can be set up on our website.

Organisational matters Duration of the SIG SSLA steering committee election cycle We did not make a decision about this when we elected the commitee The members present in this meeting have no strong opinion about the matter Ideally the full committee would not be replaced at once. Instead a certain overlap of members should uphold continuity The current committee (Martin Hinz, Sophie Schmidt, Clemens Schmid) will prepare a suggestion for the next meeting &amp;ldquo;How to join&amp;rdquo; instructions Martin Hinz prepared a guide with steps for new members to formally join the SIG Everybody liked it - except for the name &amp;ldquo;Boarding guide&amp;rdquo;, which should be changed (according to the native speakers) A link to the document can be found in the Slack channel The document is available for review until 2021-07-08.</description></item><item><title>Tools for the Revolution: developing packages for scientific programming in archaeology</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/sessions/caa2021_session/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/sessions/caa2021_session/</guid><description>When: 2021-06-16, 09:50–12:20 (UTC)

Abstract The increasing use of scientific programming languages (e.g. R or Python) is transforming the practice of quantitative archaeology. This “tool-driven revolution” (Schmidt and Marwick 2020) promises to greatly improve the accessibility, power, and reproducibility of computational analyses. It is a core component of the “Third Science Revolution” (Kristiansen 2014), which has major theoretical and practical implications for the discipline of archaeology as a whole.</description></item><item><title>Developing R packages</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/sessions/caa2021_workshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/sessions/caa2021_workshop/</guid><description>When: 2021-06-14

Abstract A growing number of researchers use the scripting language R (R Core Team 2020) for scientific data analysis. Many organise their code in scripts and functions to perform sequences of data manipulation, statistics and visualisation. Sometimes these workflows gain in complexity and it becomes feasible to outsource core components into a dedicated R package. Packages are one of the best ways to make R code reproducible as they provide a well established structure to share functions, data and their documentation with other R-users.</description></item><item><title>8th regular meeting</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2021-06-04/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2021-06-04/</guid><description>9 ppl attended

Abstract Scientific scripting languages are a very powerful tool for scientists to translate research questions and quantitative analysis into a machine-readable, executable and thus reproducible form. In order to promote and support their dissemination to the archaeological community, we have de facto established the Special Interest Group for Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology at CAA2019 in Krakow.</description></item><item><title>CAA2019 Roundtable Discussion</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2019-04-24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2019-04-24/</guid><description>Introductory Statements

Abstract In general, scientific scripting languages are the best interface for archaeologists to translate research questions into a machine-readable and executable form for quantitative analysis. For every step of data processing – data acquisition, analysis and presentation – there are high-quality software frameworks that enable fast, elegant, human-readable and reproducible coding. And yet, script languages are still not widely used! One of the main reason for this is the often steep learning curve.</description></item><item><title>Statement of purpose</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/about/</guid><description>SIG SSLA The purpose of the CAA Special Interest Group Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology is to promote the widespread implementation of computer scripts in archaeology. We will provide an exchange platform for scientists in and around archaeology who use scripting languages to conduct major or minor parts of their research. Scripts are computer programs that automate the execution of various kinds of tasks and are typically used by scientists to process and visualize information in ways that are amenable to the principles of open research.</description></item><item><title>Andrea Titolo</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Applying Archaeological Research Software Engineering as Little Minions: Statistical &amp; Computational Approaches to Daily Archaeological Tasks</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/sessions/eaa2024_session/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/sessions/eaa2024_session/</guid><description>When: 2024&amp;ndash;08 Where: Sapienza University of Rome Piazzale Aldo Moro, 5, 00185 Roma RM, Italy
Abstract Nowadays computer applications as well as statistical and computational approaches constitute a big part of the toolbox of every archaeologist, as they open tremendous possibilities for all research. These can be ready-to-use (proprietary) software applications but also “Little Minions” (self-scripted tools) or research software (e.g. implementation of statistic algorithms in R, Python), which are written by researchers.</description></item><item><title>Ben Marwick</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Bjørn Peare Bartholdy</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>David N.

This year at the CAA 2020 in Oxford we will submit a bid to have this group accepted as an official SIG of the CAA. In a preliminary enquiry to the CAA, we were told that we should illustrate in the bid that we already have support, preferably by compiling a list of archaeologists expressing their interest in the new SIG.</description></item><item><title>Lisa Steinmann</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Miguel Carrero</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Mikel Díaz</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Peter Demján</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Petr Pajdla</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Sébastien Plutniak</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Special interest group proposal</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/caa_proposal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/caa_proposal/</guid><description>Dear honourable members of the CAA Steering Committee,
