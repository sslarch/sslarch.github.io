You have questions about the qualifications you need? You want to know how to become a member? Wondering what the benefits are? Ask no more! Here are the answers you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-needed-to-become-a-member"&gt;What is needed to become a member&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the prerequisites, there are really none, except an interest in advancing transparency in archaeological research through both human and machine-readable computer programs. Whether you are already an experienced programmer in this field, or you are just starting out, it does not matter. Our group aims to provide an inclusive forum for exchange. Furthermore, we have made it our task to spread the knowledge about the possibilities and advantages of scripts over point and click software for scientific work and to establish it in a broad user group. Therefore, we are happy about every new member and hope that you will enrich us with your input and questions. To become a member of the Special Interest Group, you also do not have to be necessarily a member of CAA as such.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Letter to the members of the SIG</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/letter_members_bid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/letter_members_bid/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Dear colleagues,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are receiving this message because you are listed on the mailing list as a potential member of a CAA Special Interest Group (SIG) &amp;lsquo;Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year at the CAA 2020 in Oxford we will submit a bid to have this group accepted as an official SIG of the CAA. In a preliminary enquiry to the CAA, we were told that we should illustrate in the bid that we already have support, preferably by compiling a list of archaeologists expressing their interest in the new SIG.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Special interest group proposal</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/caa_proposal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/caa_proposal/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Dear honourable members of the CAA Steering Committee,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this letter, we would like to express our intention to establish a &lt;strong&gt;CAA Special Interest Group&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology (SIG-SSLA)&lt;/strong&gt; under the auspices of the CAA. The idea for this SIG was developed in 2018 in a session on R as an archaeological tool. Out of this event and the resulting discussions, it was proposed to form such a Special Interest Group to create a permanent platform for the exchange and discussion of ideas and to develop the practical use of R for archaeological applications. After further discussions with colleagues, it became clear that it would be a good idea to extend the focus to all scientific script languages.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Twitter guidelines</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/twitter_guidelines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/twitter_guidelines/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="we-can-collect-here-what-we-would-like-to-use-twitter-for"&gt;We can collect here what we would like to use Twitter for&lt;/h2&gt;
